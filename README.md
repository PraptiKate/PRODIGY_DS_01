# Task 1: Visualizing Population Distribution

## Objective
In this task, I visualized the global population distribution across different countries, using bar charts and histograms. The objective was to better understand the population trends and how countries are distributed by population size.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: World Bank Population Data
- **Link**: [World Bank Population Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

## Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing data and ensured data consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized population distribution using bar charts and histograms.
3. **Visualization**: Used Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.

## Key Insights
- Countries like China, India, and the US have the largest populations.
- Most countries have populations less than 50 million.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Files
- **Population_Distribution.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the code for analysis and visualization.

## Conclusion
This task enhanced my understanding of population distribution and allowed me to explore visual storytelling with data, providing valuable insights into global demographics.
